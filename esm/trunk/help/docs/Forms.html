<h1><a title="formintro" name="formintro"></a>Introduction to Forms<br /></h1>
<p>The forms area addresses the need for the ESM end user to be able to create end user submittable forms on managed sites.  Users can receive form submissions by email and or view previous submissions in the ESM.</p>
<p><strong>Summary :</strong> Forms are created in the ESM, in the forms area, and then become accessible to pages as embeddable objects. One form can be embedded in multiple places on the site.</p>
<h1><a title="addform" name="addform"></a>Adding a form</h1>

<li>Click Save. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note : </strong>When a form is saved, changes will be immediately updated on any embedded form on the site. Data submitted before the change will still be available in the submitted <a href="#viewsubmitted">Form Data</a> section of the site.</p>

<h1><a title="updateform" name="updateform"></a>Update a form</h1>

<h1><a title="deleteform" name="deleteform"></a>Delete a form</h1>

</ol>
<p><strong>Note : </strong>A form may not be deleted if it is currently embedded in a page.

Remove the reference in that page and then come back and delete the form.</p>
<h1><a title="formfields" name="formfields"></a>Form fields</h1>
<p>This section describes the fields in the <em>Properties</em> accordion available when adding or editing a form.  To learn more about creating the form structure visible to the end user, see the <a href="#createformstructure">Creating the form structure</a> section of this document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Form Name : </strong>The form name is the unique handle that is referenced while embedding a form in a page or when identifying form submissions in the submitted <a href="#viewsubmitted">Form Data</a> area.</p>
<p><strong>Email Recipient : </strong>A valid email. Submitted forms will be sent to this email address.  Currently only supports a single recipient.</p>
<p><strong>Form Submission Reply : </strong>This is the text that a user will see after submitting the form.  The page will reload and the text will be displayed above the form.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a title="createformstructure" name="createformstructure"></a>Creating the form structure</h1>
<p>To edit the form structure, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Forms tab in the main ESM navigation.</li>
<li>Find and edit the form that you wish to edit by locating it in the left nav or using the search feature also in the left area.</li>
<li>In the <em>form content</em> accordion, either click on the existing forms or in the upper left of the gray box on the blue highlighted area.  This should open the form editor.</li>
</ol>
<p>The form editor has two columns. The first is where you choose the control from. The second is where you see what the form will look like.</p>
<p>Use the first column as a toolbox of icons that you can drag over to the content area.</p>
<p>Once the icon is dropped into the content box, it will go to the bottom of the list.  The item will then be dragable via its red drag handle.  Use this feature to order the fields of the form.</p>
<p>Also note the delete icon to the right of the drag icon. Use this to remove this field from the form.</p>
<p>Once the item is in the right order, you will be able to configure it.</p>
<p><strong>Field Configuration</strong></p>
<p><strong>All fields: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Make Required :</strong> All fields can be made required or optional by checking or unchecking this checkbox.  Checking it will generate client-side form validation.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>All fields have a label. This label will appear to the left of the form when displayed. To activate the label, click on the  text.  It will highlight and then turn into a textbox with an <em>Ok</em> Button.  Enter some text for the label of the field and click <em>Ok</em> to save it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Options for Select Menu, Radio Group, and Checkbox Group : </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The select, radio, and checkbox field types can have multiple preset options.  Configure these by using the  <em>Add</em> or <em>Remove</em> items.</p>
<p>To add an option, click on the  text.  It will highlight and then turn into a textbox with an <em>Ok</em> Button.  Enter some text for the label of the option and click <em>Ok</em> to save it.</p>
<p>To add more options, click Add next to the last option and repeat the instruction above.</p>
</blockquote>
